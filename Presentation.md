*I had chosen to take Turkey's flag as it was simple and had many possibilities*

##Research on Turkey's Flag

The flag is often called al bayrak (the red flag) and referred to as al sancak (the red banner) in the Turkish national anthem.

Red is the primary colour in the flag, red means: love, emotion, blood, passion, power, danger and is a strong colour in Islam and China (good luck). Obviously Turkey haven't used red for all of these representations however they have used it for most.

The crescent is also supposed to be a symbol in Islam as they follow the moon calendar.

##Elments Rotated And Elements Copied

In this variation of the flag I had editted the star and crescent to be a representation of a parachute and star. I was trying to show Turkey to be supportive even if someone is falling fast. I have also added two stars in the back to aid support.

##Flag Colour Changed

I have used black and white becuase I wanted to represent day and night. In addition, they both have great properties I would like to represent, white is a symbol of innocence, honesty and purity. Black is associated with power and strength. HOWEVER, a lot of people associate black with death.

##Eclipse

In this variation, I wanted to keep both elements and wanted to show an eclipse. The outcome did not look very appealing however it is a learning kerb. I chose to use a green and blue to represent sky and land. Blue is also a representation of calmness, trust and loyalty. Green is also good for stability and safety, peace and harmony.

##Enlarge the Crescent

Keeping the red as it is a big part of Turkey, based on the primary beliefs of the country. I enlarged the crescent to emphasise the point that it is a bigger part in Islam.
